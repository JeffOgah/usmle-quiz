    Most laboratories screen 'at risk' patients with either a snake venom (e.g.
    dilute Russell's viper venom time) based test or an aPTT based test. In both
    methods, the time it takes for blood to clot is decreased in the presence of the
    factor V Leiden mutation. This is done by running two tests simultaneously;
    one test is run in the presence of activated protein C (APC) and the other, in
    the absence. A ratio is determined based on the two tests and the results
    signify to the laboratory whether APC is working or not. <br />
    Genetic Test: The mutation (a 1691G→A substitution) removes a cleavage site

    `Newborn baby and had meconium aspiration and then later developed
  respiratory distress with feeding. X-ray had infiltrates. What is it due to?`,
    `pneumothorax due to aspiration of faeces <br />
  Meuconium Aspiration complications: <br />
  Pulmonary Artery HTN, Air leak (Pneumothorax and Pneumomediastinum), <br />
  Aspiration Pneumonitis <br />
  X-Ray – patchy infiltrates, flattened diaphragms, increased AP Diameter <br /> <br />
  Usually, small amounts of meconium migrate slowly to the peripheral airways.
  This mechanism can create a ball valve phenomenon, in which air flows past
  the meconium during inspiration but is trapped distally during expiration,
  leading to increases in expiratory lung resistance, functional residual capacity,
  and anteroposterior diameter of the chest. Regional atelectasis and
  ventilation-perfusion mismatches develop from total obstruction of the small
  airways. Adjacent areas often are partially obstructed and overexpanded,
  leading to pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum air leaks. Pulmonary air
  leaks are ten times more likely to develop in infants with meconium aspiration
  than those without, and leaks often develop during resuscitation.`
