  Most laboratories screen 'at risk' patients with either a snake venom (e.g.
  dilute Russell's viper venom time) based test or an aPTT based test. In both
  methods, the time it takes for blood to clot is decreased in the presence of the
  factor V Leiden mutation. This is done by running two tests simultaneously;
  one test is run in the presence of activated protein C (APC) and the other, in
  the absence. A ratio is determined based on the two tests and the results
  signify to the laboratory whether APC is working or not. <br />
